# Netflix Visualization

I've created a tableau visualization for Netflix Data, which displays various information from the dataset, including but not limited to the distribution between movies/tv shows, ratings, country and much more.

The dashboard can be accessed using the link: https://public.tableau.com/views/NetflixVisualization_17247273581690/Netflix?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
